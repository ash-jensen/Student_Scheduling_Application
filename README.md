Student Scheduling Application

This is an Android scheduling application for students to keep track of terms, courses within each term, and assessments within each course. You can edit, add, delete and view all information for terms, courses, and assessments.  You can also set alerts for upcoming assessments. This Android app uses a SQLite database.

Below is the storyboard I created to show the flow of the mobile aplicaiton.
